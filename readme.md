# üß† Legal PDF Summarizer Web Application

A powerful web-based tool to **upload**, **analyze**, and **summarize lengthy legal PDF documents** using a large language model (`deepseek-ai/deepseek-llm-7b-chat`). Ideal for lawyers, legal researchers, or anyone needing fast insights from legal content.

## üìå Features

* üìÑ Upload PDF legal documents.
* üîç Automatic extraction and cleaning of text.
* ü§ñ Chunk-wise summarization using a 7B LLM with instruction-tuned prompts.
* üïí Built-in timeout protection (7 minutes max per request).
* üíæ Download summaries in `.txt` format.
* üß™ Fallback to partial content summary if the full process fails.

## üöÄ Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/legal-pdf-summarizer.git
cd legal-pdf-summarizer
```

### 2. Create a Virtual Environment

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # or `venv\Scripts\activate` on Windows
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If `requirements.txt` doesn't exist yet, here‚Äôs a typical content:

```txt
Flask
PyPDF2
transformers
torch
```

Ensure your environment supports GPU (CUDA or bfloat16) for optimal performance.

### 4. Run the Web App

```bash
python app.py
```

Visit [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000) in your browser.

---

## üß™ Sample Usage via CLI (Optional)

You can also use the script directly via command line:

```bash
python pdf_summarizer.py
```

You'll be prompted to input the path of a PDF file. The script extracts, summarizes, and saves both the cleaned text and summary as `.txt` files.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration & Customization

* **Model Selection**: You can change the `model_name` in `summarize_long_text()` to another `transformers`-compatible LLM.
* **Summary Length**: Adjust `max_new_tokens` in `generate_summary()` or final summary generation.
* **Timeout**: Configurable in JavaScript frontend (`420000 ms = 7 minutes`).

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Notes

* For large PDFs (>50MB), consider pre-splitting before uploading.
* Encrypted or scanned PDFs may not yield proper results.
* The LLM summarizer assumes a stable internet or cached model if run locally with HuggingFace transformers.
